# Module2_challenge
This challenge is part of my Front-end development bootcamp. It contains HTML and CSS codes.
The project has the following goals:

When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications

When presented with my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

The challenge contains placeholders at points instead of taking to real deployed pages, therefore it is suitable to personalised updates at any time
